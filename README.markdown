# puller <-

Puller is a file sharing app that uses HTTP and (will use) bittorrent as well.

It's just... cool. I mean, it's [Sinatra](http://sinatra.github.com/). And it's... 
web two-point-oh. I'll probably add a few useless coffee-brewing Rack middlewares 
in just to make sure companies will invest billions of dollars on it.
